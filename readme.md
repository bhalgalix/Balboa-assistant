# API Starter - Alexa Skill Template

This is an Alexa skill template that provides a simple example of a skill that calls an external API. The API used is the [api.open-notify.org API](http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json) which returns a list of the astronauts currently in space.

### Using this template

This template uses the [Alexa Skills Kit SDK 2.0 for Node.js](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs) and was designed to be used with the [Alexa Skills Kit Command-Line Interface](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-intro.html) (aka: ASK-CLI). After installing the ASK-CLI you can run the following command to setup a new skill project based on this template.

`$ ask new --url http://skilltemplates.com/templates.json`

After running the previous command you'll see of list of templates to choose from. Pick the template named `API Starter`. This will create a new folder named `./api-starter/` all of the code for the template will be located in that folder.
